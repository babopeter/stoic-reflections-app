# Weekly Stoic Review

*(End-of-week reflection — objective, brief, corrective)*

“Waste no more time arguing what a good person should be. Be one.”  
— Marcus Aurelius

---

## 1. Orientation (2 minutes)

Before reviewing anything:

☐ Sit quietly for 3–5 breaths  

☐ Notice current mood without analysis  

☐ Acknowledge: “This review is for correction, not judgment.”

---

## 2. Attention Audit (3–5 minutes)

**Where did my attention actually go this week?**  
Answer factually, not aspirationally.

☐ Work / study  

☐ Relationships  

☐ Distraction (scrolling, media, avoidance)  

☐ Worry / rumination  

☐ Physical training / health  

☐ Rest / presence  

**Reflection**

Where was attention well spent?  

Where was it wasted?  

What patterns repeat?

---

## 3. Emotional Review (3–5 minutes)

**What emotions dominated?**  
List 2–4, no stories.

☐ Anger / irritation  

☐ Anxiety / worry  

☐ Shame / regret  

☐ Contentment / gratitude  

☐ Boredom / restlessness  

**Key Questions**

Which emotions were prolonged unnecessarily?  

Where did narrative extend emotion beyond its natural lifespan?  

Did I notice emotions early—or only after acting?

---

## 4. Stoic Control Check (3–4 minutes)

Using the Stoic distinction of control (as articulated by Epictetus):

**Situations that disturbed me:**  

For each, answer briefly:

Was this within my control? ☐ Yes ☐ No  

Did I act as if it was? ☐ Yes ☐ No  

What was within my control that I neglected?

No moralizing. Only correction.

---

## 5. Speech & Action Review (3–5 minutes)

“Where you stumble, there lies your task.”  
— Seneca

This week, did I:

☐ Speak when silence was wiser?  

☐ Remain silent when honesty was required?  

☐ Act from impulse rather than reason?  

☐ Avoid necessary discomfort?  

**Choose one moment:**

What was the better response?  

What cue should I notice next time?

---

## 6. Self & Ego Check (2–3 minutes)

Answer honestly:

Where did self-image drive my behavior?  

Where did I seek validation, status, or reassurance?  

Where did self-concern reduce presence or compassion?  

Then ask:

Did self-focus improve this situation—or degrade it?

---

## 7. Gratitude & Mortality (2–3 minutes)

**Gratitude**

One thing I took for granted this week:  

One ordinary moment worth repeating:  

**Mortality Reminder**

If this week were repeated for the last time:

What would I do differently?  

What would I stop postponing?  

No drama. Only clarity.

---

## 8. One Correction for Next Week (2 minutes)

This is the most important step.

Complete only one sentence:

**Next week, when ______ occurs, I will ______.**

Examples:

“When I feel rushed, I will slow my speech.”  

“When irritation arises, I will pause before replying.”  

“When distraction appears, I will return to the task for 5 minutes.”

Keep it behavioral and concrete.

---

## 9. Closing Reset (1 minute)

☐ Take one breath  

☐ Drop the review  

☐ Begin the next week without carrying self-judgment forward  

---

## Rules for This Review (Non-Negotiable)

Do not track streaks or scores  

Do not narrate progress  

Do not weaponize insight against yourself  

Missed weeks do not matter — resume immediately  

This review is not about becoming better as a person.  
It is about suffering less, acting more cleanly, and wasting less attention.
